## About Me

Hey there! I’m Dylan Dombrowski — a tech enthusiast and current IT Rotational Analyst (ITLP) at Churchill Downs Inc. My journey spans pizza to pixels, starting in my family’s kitchen at Pizza Mia in New Lenox, IL (check it out!) and now building innovative software.

**Career Path:**
- **IT Rotational Program:** 2 years, 4 rotations (6 months each)
  - **Twinspires:** Software Development (React, Next.js, Supabase, ML, TypeScript, Tailwind)
  - **Churchill Downs Inc.:** Network Engineering
  - **BRM Team:** Business Relationship Management, working on Micros Simphony solutions

**Certifications:**
- Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt
- Working toward CompTIA Network+ & AWS Practitioner

**Projects:**
- **TallyRoster:** My most ambitious project nearing completion! An all in one team management solution
- **POS System:** Big dreams, half-baked (for now) — hoping to revisit as a 3rd-party dev for major POS platforms

**Philosophy:**  
Professional, but always casual and friendly. We’re here to create, grow, and prosper — together!
